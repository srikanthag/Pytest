my framework consist of following folders

1. driver folder: it hold .exe file of webdriver

2. library: This folder consist
a.config: Config files holds project related structure like URL, username,password

b.conftest: Fixtures can be shared or re-used in different test methods Like Launching browser, navigating to URL,
login, logout and closing the browser and across multiple files through a special python file “conftest.py”.

The fixture present in “conftest.py” automatically get discovered by pytest.
Pytest fixture is a callable (normally a function or a generator) decorated with inbuilt pytest decorator @fixture
Fixtures are used for dependency injection or to pass the data to the test functions.

c.All generic functions for clicking on element, entering text, selecting item from the list box would be maintained
in a separate class called "SeleniumWrapper".

d.We have written a wait decorator for Synchronisation. Each generic function is being decorated with wait decorator.
So, before performing any action on a web element, the decorator checks if the element is visible and enabled.

3. POM: It consist automation script for all modules.

4. Test: This folder consist test scripts

5. Test data: For each page we create a separate work sheet and maintain all the locators in that worksheet and we maintain
separate test data sheet where we divide the test data based on modules. We maintain separate worksheet in excel for
each module. The test data required for all the test cases for each module will be maintained in the corresponding
worksheet.

6. Reports: HTML reports will be generated in "Reports" folder and all the screenshots will be taken in "Screenshots" folder.

In pytest, assert is used to verify if a particular condition is True during the execution of the test. If the condition is True, the test passes; if the condition is False, pytest raises an AssertionError, which causes the test to fail.

def test_addition():
    result = 1 + 1
    assert result == 2  # Passes, because 1 + 1 equals 2

def test_subtraction():
    result = 2 - 1
    assert result == 1  # Passes, because 2 - 1 equals 1

def test_addition1():
    result = 1 + 1
    assert result == 3  # Fails, because 1 + 1 does not equal 3  # AssertionError

assert checks if an expression is True. If it is, the test passes. If it is not, pytest raises an AssertionError and the test fails.
You can include custom error messages to make failures clearer.
assert can be used in combination with other pytest features like raises to test exceptions.
